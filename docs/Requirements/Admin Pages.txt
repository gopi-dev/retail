Requirements

Admin pages:

- Actions that the user can do: Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete. In addition to this, the user should be able to search the entities based on certain fields. Those searchable/indexed fields are higlighted with * below.
- Display the exisitng entities by default - paginated (10 per page; make it customizable, do not hard code)
- The retrieve/Update/Delete options for an entity will be present next to the entity.
- The user should be able to do a group action on entities. For now, just allow Delete. Update is complex and varies per entity and the property that is being updated - so we skip it for now.
